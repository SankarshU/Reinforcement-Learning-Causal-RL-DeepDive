# Reinforcement-Learning-DeepDive
Look at the RL paradigm at a fundamental level with relevant notes, courses, materials, and experiment notebooks, digging into RL a level deeper.

#### RL and Deep RL have a wealth of material available; this is one such attempt to delve deeply into the subject to help study and understand state-of-the-art research
- The following will be covered:
  - RL & Deep RL [fundamentals](https://github.com/SankarshU/Reinforcement-Learning-DeepDive/tree/846cc33ee84f8807abcc63b898f34d94385384aa/Basics):
    - Concepts and illustrations from the following courses, additional experiments beyond assignments:
      - [Berkeley Deep RL][[link](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)]
      - [Practical RL][[link](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)]
  - Causal Reinforcement Learning research [exploration](https://github.com/SankarshU/Reinforcement-Learning-DeepDive/tree/71c25d91abea2bc68876c736fae8632b5143061a/CausalRL):
    - Summarizing or deep diving into research
  - Deep RL literature deep dive to explore the developments in this field-[current-research](https://github.com/SankarshU/Reinforcement-Learning-DeepDive/blob/c6bd0d27c9566eb535946a8243cfb0e765a20c72/Latest-Research/Readme.md):
